    <body>
            <p>I'm a beauty and fashion blogger living in Sydney, Australia. I’ve been a Social Media Manager at an eCommerce store and I’m currently working as a Marketing Assistant at a Sydney Marketing Agency. </p>
            <p>My blog, writing and Instagram are my my happy side-project at the moment. Since 2017, I have been sharing the clothes, sales and online shopping sites that I love in my own corner of the internet. So many of my readers have been around since those days, all going through growing up, right alongside me.</p>

            <p>Currently in 2020 I have met so many bloggers, discovered so many like-minded people, and has so many amazing opportunities I had once only dreamed of. </p>
            <p>I collaborate on paid and gifted campaigns to work with Australian and International brands. I am always exploring my own scope on style, trends, beauty, lifestyle events and things happening around Perth. If you want to learn more about what I do, see my Services.</p>
                    
                   <p> Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy reading! </p>
